The user will be able to search for a city and the application will use public APIs to extract information about said city. I built this project to get a better grasp of JavaScript and the MVC architecture. Building this project enabled me to learn more about the usage of APIs and how a proper architecture helps in the maintainability of a codebase. I learned that data from one API can be used for queries to another API, this is very helpful since it enables me to chain different functions to get a proper result.",
